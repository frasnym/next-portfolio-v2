        <p><b>Hi! <Emoji symbol="ðŸ‘‹" /></b>, I love building new things with code and traveling with the earnings.</p>
        <p>The first time I knew about programming was in my college days. The first programming language I knew was <b>PHP</b> and since then I started building websites with it.</p>
        <p>I got my first job as a full-stack developer after 1 year I graduated from college. At that time it was difficult to get a job as a programmer. <br /><i>FYI</i>, I live in Bali; One of the islands in Indonesia. A suitable place if you want to go on vacation in my opinion. Therefore, most of the job opportunities are opened for tourism, not technology.</p>

        <p>After 3 years working with PHP, I want to develop my career and start working with <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Golang</b> programming languages. I started working with a big team and learned a lot of new things.</p>
        <p>Until now, I have been working in programming for about 4 years. I'm used to working in teams, working with senior developers who always help raise my standart  for applications that can be used by wider community.</p>
        <p>Lastly, if you need help building something to achieve your goals with code or just want to know more about me. Feel free to contact me on any of my social media <Emoji symbol='ðŸ˜‰' />.</p>
