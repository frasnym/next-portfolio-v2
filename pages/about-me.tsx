        <p><b>Hi! <Emoji symbol="ðŸ‘‹" /></b>, I love building new things with code and traveling with the earnings.</p>
        <p>
          The first time I knew about programming was in my college days. 
          The first programming language I knew was <b>PHP</b> and since then I started building websites with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got my first job as a full-stack developer after 1 year I graduated from college. 
          At that time it was difficult to get a job as a programmer. <br /><i>FYI</i>, I live in Bali; One of the islands in Indonesia. 
          A suitable place if you want to go on vacation in my opinion. 
          Therefore, most of the job opportunities are opened for tourism, not technology.
        </p>
        <BaliContainer>
          <div><Image src='https://i.ibb.co/fYpKzSy/bali2.jpg' alt='Photo of Bali 1' height={128} width={160} /></div>
          <div><Image src='https://i.ibb.co/t3K0qGn/bali1.jpg' alt='Photo of Bali 2' height={128} width={160} /></div>
          <br />
          <text>This is some photos of Bali</text>
        </BaliContainer>
        <p>
          After 3 years working with PHP, I want to develop my career and start working with <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Golang</b> programming languages. 
          I started working with a big team and learned a lot of new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until now, I have been working in programming for about 4 years. 
          I&apos;m used to working in teams, working with senior developers who always help raise my standart for applications 
          that can be used by wider community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, if you need help building something to achieve your goals with code or just want to know more about me. 
          Feel free to contact me on any of my social media <Emoji symbol='ðŸ˜‰' />.
